// Admin-only command to view entire database

// I am going to argue against having this as a slash command
// What I want is a way for the only the core team to see the entire database
// You can just go to DynamoDB GUI and download the entire database as a CSV

// This functionality is too powerful to set up as a slash command
// No need to go through the process of setting up custom permissions for this slash command
// It seems that you need to customize permissions config for each server setup individually, using Discord client/guild/role IDs. I can't find the GUI to do this.
// Also it's better to hide this functionality entirely from Discord users, with a slash command the slash command is still visible even if a user doesn't have the permissions to use it
